# 🚀 QManager BETA v0.1.21

A small quality-of-life release: a new **Ethernet Port LEDs** control for carrier boards that suppress RJ45 LEDs, and two community-contributed language packs — **Italian** 🇮🇹 and **Indonesian** 🇮🇩.

## ✨ New Features

- **Ethernet Port LEDs card (Local Network).** Opt-in toggle that disables Wake-on-LAN on `eth0` to restore RJ45 port LEDs on carrier boards that suppress them while WoL is armed — notably **rework.network's 5G2PHY** and other QCA8081-based designs. No functional impact: Wake-on-LAN is unused on always-on gateway devices. The card auto-hides on hardware where WoL control isn't available, so you'll only see it if it's useful. Toggling the switch briefly bounces the Ethernet link (~2–5 seconds) — the UI shows a countdown and reconnects automatically.
- **Italian language pack 🇮🇹.** QManager's first community-contributed translation, courtesy of **@fmase**. Install it from **System Settings → Languages → Available** — the pack downloads directly to the device, no firmware update needed. Partial translations fall back to English, so you'll never see an untranslated blank string.
- **Indonesian language pack 🇮🇩.** Second community translation, courtesy of **@ikhsanh**. Install from the same Languages card. A handful of strings added late in this release cycle still fall back to English — a follow-up update is already requested.

## ✅ Improvements

- **Faster signal updates everywhere.** Per-antenna RSRP, RSRQ, and SINR now refresh every 2 seconds across Cellular Information, Antenna Statistics, and Antenna Alignment — five times more responsive than before. The dashboard Signal History chart now plots the last 10 seconds with relative `-10s … Now` labels (matching the Live Latency chart) so you can see signal swings the moment they happen. Antenna Alignment slot recordings finish in ~6 s instead of ~30 s.
- **Contributor-friendly i18n workflow.** The `docs/i18n/CONTRIBUTING.md` guide is live, and the language-pack publishing pipeline is now scripted — expect more community packs in upcoming releases.
- **Polished language-pack UI.** The sidebar switcher now shows both native and English names (e.g. *Italiano (Italian)*) with a base-code fallback so locales like `it-IT` no longer collapse to a bare `it`. Toast messages across install, remove, and activate flows now read formally and include the language code — e.g. *Language Italian (it) removed* instead of *it removed*.
