# 🚀 QManager BETA v0.1.21

A small quality-of-life release: a new **Ethernet Port LEDs** control for carrier boards that suppress RJ45 LEDs, and our first community-contributed language pack — **Italian** 🇮🇹.

## ✨ New Features

- **Ethernet Port LEDs card (Local Network).** Opt-in toggle that disables Wake-on-LAN on `eth0` to restore RJ45 port LEDs on carrier boards that suppress them while WoL is armed — notably **rework.network's 5G2PHY** and other QCA8081-based designs. No functional impact: Wake-on-LAN is unused on always-on gateway devices. The card auto-hides on hardware where WoL control isn't available, so you'll only see it if it's useful. Toggling the switch briefly bounces the Ethernet link (~2–5 seconds) — the UI shows a countdown and reconnects automatically.
- **Italian language pack 🇮🇹.** QManager's first community-contributed translation, courtesy of **@fmase**. Install it from **System Settings → Languages → Available** — the pack downloads directly to the device, no firmware update needed. Partial translations fall back to English, so you'll never see an untranslated blank string.

## ✅ Improvements

- **Contributor-friendly i18n workflow.** The `docs/i18n/CONTRIBUTING.md` guide is live, and the language-pack publishing pipeline is now scripted — expect more community packs in upcoming releases.
